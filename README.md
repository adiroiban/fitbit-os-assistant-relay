# fitbit-os-assistant-relay

A simple Fitbit OS app for controling things via a Google Assistant Relay.

In order to be functional you will need to a Google Assistant Relay server
in your local network.

The IP and PORT is configurable.

Set up the app with the name of your things and control them from Fitbit OS.

The Google Assistant SDK only allows broadcast messages and turning on/off
the plugs and lights or entire rooms. For example you can't control Spotify.

It might be worth adding color temperature... or even color for ligths, but
I feel that the UI will be too heavy.

The app was developed and tested using
https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay.

The app was tested only using the simulator.
